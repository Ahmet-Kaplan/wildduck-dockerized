## Set up Docker
Install Docker:
```console
$ curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
$ sh get-docker.sh
```

Install docker-compose
```console
$ sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.28.2/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
$ sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
```

## Deploy Wildduck: dockerized
Create a new directory and run the setup script. The script only copies the default `config` folder, `.env`, `docker-compose.yml`, and edits them for your domain. It does not install anything.

The setup script takes 1-2 arguments. The domain for your email (e.g `example.com`), and the hostname where your mail server will be (e.g `mail.example.com`). They can be the same host, if you host your website on the same server for example.
```console
$ mkdir wildduck-dockerized
$ cd wildduck-dockerized
$ docker run --rm -v "${PWD}:/wildduck-dockerized" nodemailer/wildduck-dockerized-setup domainname [hostname]
```

Optionally set your contact address in the `.env` file for lets encrypt expiry notices:
```sh
# Used as the lets encrypt contact address for expiry notices: https://letsencrypt.org/docs/expiration-emails/
ACME_EMAIL=john@example.com
```

Deploy using docker-compose:
```console
$ docker-compose up -d
```

## Custom configuration
Configuration files for all services reside in `./config`. Alter them in whichever way you want, and restart the service in question.
